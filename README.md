# AspireTask
In this repo, I have added a python file which completes the task.
If python is not installed in your system, download the installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/ for your respective system. 
Python version used: 3.8
selenium version used: "4.1.2"

In test_sample.py file, single file has a complete script that completes all the test cases which were mentioned in the assignment.
